I have created a test function for the game, so you don't need to play the whole game but can test each level directly.

Open 1.1 scene -> Canvas -> Btn -> Year2 -> enable this.
Open 2.1 scene -> Canvas -> Btn -> GoYear3 -> enable this.

* Note: this is only for testing each level, for minigame you need to unlock it by yourself inside the game.
        The way to unlock he minigame is to collect 10 credits in the level.

###### Game Story ######

Mario, the famous plumber, has decided to take a break from his adventures in the Mushroom Kingdom and pursue higher education. 
He has enrolled in Durham University to study computer science. As Mario progresses through the levels, he learns about the different topics
in computer science, such as Web development, Machine Learning etc. He uses his newfound knowledge to defeat Bowser's minions and do the 
coursework in the meantime. Frederick Li is the person who is able to assist him. With determination, Mario sets out on a new adventure 
that will test his skills both in and out of the classroom. Will he be able to save the university and earn his degree in computer science? 
Only time will tell.

###### Game Instruction ######
